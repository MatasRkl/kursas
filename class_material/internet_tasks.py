2. Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of
all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is,
it is a number that divides evenly into another number.
For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

3. Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. (Hint: Ask for player plays (using input),
